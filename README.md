Chromium Embedded Framework ( CEF ) has also been used to render the graphical user interface and has a built-in web server for running the application.

> ### What are the challenges faced during development?

When developing the EHR using CEF, I faced the challenge of ensuring everything worked properly on multiple devices. To address this, I tested my code on a variety of different devices, and worked to ensure the website was compatible with all of them. In the end, the website worked properly on all platforms.

Additionally, I was unable to observe the process while it was being developed due to my extremely limited time.
I spent a lot of time testing to make sure that all the design components were covered in order to handle this.
All of the components that were intended to be in place were eventually put into practice. 

> ### What features am I going to add later? 
In order to improve decision-making, further data analysis, and system integration, I would like to include an Analysis Block that does additional analysis on the data gathered.
